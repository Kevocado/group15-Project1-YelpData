    "Buffalo is strategically located near the Canadian border, making it a hub for cross-border travelers and international traffic. Its position as a major passage encourages frequent visitation and high footfall, especially from tourists and commuters traveling to and from Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "The city also boasts a significant Polish population, creating a built-in customer base that appreciates authentic Polish cuisine and cultural connections.\n",

    "\n",
    "Cuisine: Polish-American fusion—offering classic Polish dishes infused with American flavors or formats. Examples could include pierogi with locally-inspired fillings, kielbasa sandwiches, Polish-American burgers, or fusion desserts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Price Point: Individual meals under $20, maintaining accessibility and affordability for a variety of customers (students, families, travelers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Style: Fast-Casual Hybrid: Emphasize speed and price efficiency for tourists in transit, but offer a cozy area for locals to relax and connect.\n",

    "3. Target Customers\n",
    "\n",
    "Dual focus on Buffalo locals—especially the Polish community—ensures steady, repeat business and cultural authenticity.\n",

    "Tourists and commuters passing through Buffalo represent transient demand, bringing diversity and exposure to new customers. Strategic location near major highways and border crossings increases visibility and convenience for this segment.\n",
