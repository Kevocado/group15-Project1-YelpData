    "## Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Philadelphia has only 12 Polish restaurants, indicating a niche market with limited competition and potential for a new entrant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average rating for Polish restaurants is 4.33, with about 52 reviews per business, showing high customer satisfaction and engagement benchmarks to aim for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Polish restaurants have ratings between 4.0 and 5.0, suggesting a trend of quality and positive experiences among competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several neighborhoods in Philadelphia lack Polish restaurants, presenting location opportunities in “restaurant deserts.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Top-performing Polish restaurants prioritize attributes like accepting credit cards, creating a comfortable ambience, offering takeout, providing reservations, and allowing outdoor seating.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 26 common complaints in low-rated reviews (wait time, price, service, portion size), revealing operational pain points to avoid for success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive customer feedback in 4-star reviews emphasizes authenticity, cash payment awareness, and a comfortable atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain sub-categories (food trucks, delis, imported food) show high ratings and low competition, offering potential for specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peak check-in times are Thursday to Saturday, from 11am to 8pm, and busiest days are Wednesday to Saturday, informing staffing and marketing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Longevity does not guarantee success—older Polish restaurants sometimes have lower ratings, emphasizing the need for sustained quality and differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of 12, 7 Polish restaurants are open, 5 are closed, highlighting both market potential and operational risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key attributes among closed restaurants (credit cards, takeout, alcohol, reservations, outdoor seating) may indicate areas needing improved execution rather than features to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average review is 542 characters and the average time since last check-in is 2436 days, signaling opportunities to boost more frequent and memorable customer engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis suggests Philadelphia is a promising city for a Polish fast-casual restaurant—there is ample opportunity in underserved neighborhoods, strong community support, and benchmarks for what works operationally and culturally. Success will depend on location selection, authentic food and atmosphere, and rigorous attention to operational quality and customer engagement, to stand out in a market where a handful of competitors set high standards but leave clear gaps.​"
